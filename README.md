This is a work in progress project by sarkazein.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- üöÄ Built with Next.js 14+ and React
- üíé TypeScript support
- üé® Tailwind CSS for styling
- üîê NextAuth.js for authentication
- üì¶ MongoDB integration
- üéØ Modern UI components with shadcn/ui

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitvekariya/gittip.git
cd gittip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then update the `.env.local` file with your configuration values:
- MongoDB connection string
- NextAuth secrets and providers
- Any other required API keys

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Dependencies Installation Failed

If you encounter errors during `pnpm install` or `npm install`:

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables Not Loading

Ensure your `.env.local` file is:
- In the root directory
- Not committed to git (check `.gitignore`)
- Has all required variables from `.env.example`

Restart the development server after making changes to environment variables.

#### Port Already in Use

If you see "Port 3000 is already in use":

```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
# Then restart the dev server
pnpm dev
```

#### MongoDB Connection Issues

- Verify your MongoDB connection string is correct
- Ensure your IP address is whitelisted (for cloud databases)
- Check if MongoDB service is running (for local databases)

#### TypeScript Errors

If you encounter TypeScript compilation errors:

```bash
# Clear TypeScript cache
rm -rf .next
# Reinstall type definitions
pnpm add -D @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
# Restart the dev server
pnpm dev
```

#### Build Failures

If production build fails:

```bash
# Run build with verbose output
pnpm build --debug
# Check for missing environment variables
# Ensure all imports are correct
```

#### Hot Reload Not Working

If changes aren't reflecting in the browser:
- Clear browser cache
- Stop the dev server and restart: `pnpm dev`
- Check for syntax errors in your code
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere

#### Authentication Issues

If you're having problems with NextAuth.js:

```bash
# Verify environment variables
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set (generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- Check provider credentials (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Clear cookies and session storage in browser

#### Styling Not Applied

If Tailwind CSS styles aren't working:
- Check `tailwind.config.ts` for correct content paths
- Verify `globals.css` imports Tailwind directives
- Restart dev server after config changes
- Clear `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`

#### API Routes 404 Errors

If API routes return 404:
- Verify file is in correct location (`src/app/api/`)
- Check file naming (must be `route.ts` or `route.js`)
- Ensure proper HTTP method handler is exported (GET, POST, etc.)
- Restart development server
