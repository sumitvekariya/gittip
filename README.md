This is a work in progress project by sarkazein.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- 🚀 Built with Next.js 14+ and React
- 💎 TypeScript support
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for styling
- 🔐 NextAuth.js for authentication
- 📦 MongoDB integration
- 🎯 Modern UI components with shadcn/ui

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitvekariya/gittip.git
cd gittip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then update the `.env.local` file with your configuration values:
- MongoDB connection string
- NextAuth secrets and providers
- Any other required API keys

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
